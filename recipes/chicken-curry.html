    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First heat oil in a deep pan, then add whatever whole spices you
            have â€” bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves & green cardamoms. Fry
            them till you get an aroma, just for a min.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chopped onions and chilies. Saute till the onions turn deep
            golden in color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next add ginger garlic paste and saute till you get a nice aroma.
            This just takes about a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add tomatoes, turmeric and salt. Mix well and cook until
            the tomatoes turn soft & mushy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour yogurt (or cashew paste), red chili powder, garam masala
            & coriander powder.</p>
            <p>On a low heat, cook until the mixture smells good.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chicken and coriander leaves. Fry till the chicken turns white or pale in color. This takes around 3 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and cook on low heat for 3 or 4 mins. The step is very important as
            chicken absorbs all the flavours of the spices
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile in a seperate pot, heat up 1 cup water. Using cold wates most times toughens the
            chicken so it is good to use hot water.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How to make chicken curry</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour hot water just enough to make a thick curry. Do not add to much water.
            Chicken curry will become runny. Sometimes chicken lets out lot of moisture.
            So use only as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and cook on medium to low flame till the chicken is softly cooked and 
            the courry turns thick.
        </li>
        <li>Taste the curry & add more salt and masala if needed.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on a low flame for 3 to 5 mins. When the chicken is cooked completely it will fall of the bone easily.</li>
        <li>Lastly garnish with coriander leaves, cover and off the heat. Serve chicken curry with Naan or jeera rice.</li>
    </ol>
